# Do you like sumo ?

## Do you like wonky  physics and _hover cars_!?

### Do you like ***Reinforcement Learning***!?

Then you'll love stupid car sumo simulation trained with [Unity MLAgents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/)



This is an experiment I bodged together where I tried to train two competitive agents using the same Neural Network and a lot of trial and error to try and get a working policy.
